0x19. Postmortem
I had fun writing this project “Postmortem” .. I had to share my experience and problems encountered in the cause of running and configuring my web servers.
There are multiple challenges that Software Developers face when working on projects. Debugging is one of the major challenges in Software Engineering. 
Debugging can be frustrating, time-consuming, especially when the code is not working as expected.
Debugging is important because it allows software engineers and developers to fix errors in a program before releasing it to the public. 
As a Software Engineer you must learn from mistakes and also ensure it doesn’t happen again 

Post-mortem debugging involves inspecting the state of an application that has crashed or failed in some way, in order to determine the conditions that lead to the failure. 
Like runtime debugging, both symbolic debugging with a debugger and ad-hoc print statements are useful for analysing an application after it fails. There are, however, some additional considerations to keep in mind.
When debugging via print or logging statements, post-mortem analysis of a failed application simply involves:
Enabling logging at the lowest ('debug') level of priority, or adding appropriate print statements
Running the application until it fails
Reading through the logs to try to reconstruct what happened
 
In my Web stack debugging , there were lots of challenges
when the issue with the server started, the time zone and the duration.
